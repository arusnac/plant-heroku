        "LIGHT": "How much light for an African Violet plant: Provide an abundant amount of bright indirect light\nif you want to encourage flowers and leaf growth. A good location is close to an east-facing window. When the light is too low, the leaves on an African Violet plant turn dark green, lose their plump appearance, and the plant produces very few flowers. Leaves turn a pale yellow-green and flowers fade quickly when there is too much light.",
        "WATER": "How often should you water an African Violet plant: How you water is another important factor in helping an African Violet flower. Allow the top 1\"- 2\" of soil dry out before watering. Avoid using water that has passed through a softener or water containing chlorine or fluorine. I like to water from the bottom since this helps prevent water getting on the leaves. Set your African Violet in a deep saucer of water for 10 minutes. Refill the water as it is absorbed through the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. Remove any water that is still in the saucer after 10 minutes.",
        "FERTILIZER": "African Violet plant food: Special plant food is available wherever plants are sold. In a pinch, you can use any balanced, soluble, houseplant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Feed an African Violet plant monthly when the plant is actively growing. Over-fertilizing can cause leaf tip burn, poor flower production, leaf cracks, and may even kill the plant.",

Preventing houseplants from getting diseases is much easier than treating diseases. Provide good air circulation and never get water on the leaves of your African violet plant.",
        "SOIL": "Best soil for an African Violet plant: The soil should be a rich, airy, potting mixture. Special soil for African Violet plants is available at most garden centers. These plants benefit from some fresh, new soil every 6-12 months. Changing the soil prevents unwanted salts from fertilizer\ns building up in the soil and burning the roots and leaves.",
        "POT SIZE": "African Violet plant pot: An African Violet is usually sold in a small 4\" pot. If you keep the plant a little root-bound, you'll notice that it will flower more often. When it's time to move your African violet to a larger container, use the next size pot and nothing larger. There must be drip holes in the bottom of the pot. If the new container is too large, the soil stays wet too long, and the roots of the plant start to rot. Over- watering is one of the main reasons an African Violet plant dies.",
        "PRUNING": "How to prune an African Violet plant: Remove 2 - 4 leaves from the bottom of an African Violet plant each month to encourage new leaf development at the top of the plant. Quickly and carefully remove any dead flowers and their stalks as soon as they appear.",

        "PRUNING": "Does an agave plant need pruning: The only time an agave plant needs to be pruned is if there are dead or dying leaves on the plant. When removing leaves, use a sharp, clean knife and cut the leaf off at the soil line. Be sure to wear a long sleeve shirt and use gloves. The sap of an agave plant is very irritating and the sharp leaf tips and serrated edges can be dangerous.",
        "PROPAGATION": "How to propagate an agave plant: The best way to propagate is by using the offsets\nthat grow around the base of the plant. offsets\n, or pups as they are often called, are the tiny plants that grow around the base of a plant. Wait until the offsets\nare several inches tall, then carefully detach them from the \u201cmother\u201dplant. The offsets\nshould have a few roots by this time. Plant the offsets\nin a small pot, with drip holes in the bottom, of loose soil. Keep the soil barely moist but never soggy at all times.",
        "POISONOUS PLANT INFO": "An agave plant is a toxic plant and can be quite dangerous to have around dogs, cats, and small children. The leaves of the plant contain oxalate crystals, and if ingested, can cause swelling and difficulty breathing. Another problem is skin irritations caused when someone is pricked by the sharp leaf tips or the spines along the edges of the leaves.

        "LIGHT": "Cymbidium orchids like as much bright, indirect light as you can provide; but avoid placing them in the direct sun. Light green upright leaves indicate that your orchid plant is getting the proper amount of light. Dark green leaves mean a Cymbidium orchid needs more light. Yellow leaves are an indication that they are getting too much light.",
        "WATER": "The easiest way to kill Cymbidium orchid plants is by over-watering. When watering, thoroughly drench the plant, then let the excess water drain out the bottom drip holes. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. You can prevent over and under-watering by checking the roots, they should be whitish- green and plump. Follow these few watering tips to prevent watering problems. Never allow orchid plants sit in water. Do not get water on the leaves or flowers. Never use water that has passed through a softener. Soil type, temperature, time of year, humidity, and pot size all influence how much water orchid plants need. The soil dries out faster in winter because of the heat and low humidity in homes and offices. Too much or too little water is the main cause of Bud Blast, orchid buds dying before they open.",

Ideal temperatures for the flower buds to set is 65\u00b0F-70\u00b0F (18.3\u00b0C-21.1\u00b0C) during the day and 10\u00b0-15\u00b0 cooler at night. Temperature is especially important during the fall when orchid flowers are just starting to develop. Cymbidium plants can handle temperatures as low as 45\u00b0F (7\u00b0 C), but do not do well in temperatures above 80\u00b0 F (26.7\u00b0C). The higher the temperature, the more important it is to have good air movement around the plant.",
        "HUMIDITY": "High humidity is a necessity. If your home or office does not have at least 50% humidity, place your orchid plant on a wet pebble tray. Be sure it is sitting on the pebbles and never in the water. Do not mist an orchid plant; it can cause fungal and bacterial plant diseases.",
        "FLOWERING": "One of the nicest things about Cymbidium orchids is that they bloom in the winter when other indoor plant do not. The flower spikes on Cymbidium orchids set during the fall and winter when temperature are about 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C) at night. Once the flower spikes appear, don't move your Cymbidium orchid or keep the room too warm until the buds open. Blooms last longer when temperatures stay between 60\u00b0-70\u00b0F (15.6\u00b0-21.1\u00b0C). Be sure to stake the flower spikes so the blooms are above the leaves of the plant.

Viruses appear as pale streaks in the leaves. As the problem worsens, the leaves become pitted and bleached-out looking. Fungal infections cause yellow, brown, and then black leaves. Roots develop black spotted areas and the orchid cannot absorb water. Fungal infections on indoor orchid plant are the result of over- watering, poor air circulation, and wet foliage. Keep infected plants away from other plants or throw them out. Sterilize your scissors, knives, or other tools with alcohol before going from plant to plant. Treat fungal diseases with Fungicide\ns sold at local garden stores. Another way to treat Cymbidium orchid diseases is by using the Bordeaux Solution, a mixture of water, hydrated lime, and copper sulfate.",

        "PROPAGATION": "Propagate Cymbidium orchid plants in the spring when the plant has finished blooming. As orchid plants mature, they produce pseudobulbs. Pseudobulbs store water and nutrients and new plant leaves emerge from them. Cymbidium orchid plants should be divided every three or four years. To propagate these orchids, gently split the pseudo bulbs apart. Each section should have at least three healthy pseudobulbs. Center the orchid bulbs in the new container with the lower 1/3 of the bulb below the soil. The container should be only an inch or two larger than the pseudo bulb cluster.",
